This repository contains the user interface for a full-stack web application developed using Angular for the front end and Node.js for the backend. The user interface provides an intuitive and interactive platform for users to access and interact with the various features and functionalities of the web application..

Technologies Used:

Angular: The user interface is built using Angular, a powerful front-end framework for building dynamic and responsive single-page applications (SPAs). Angular provides a modular architecture and component-based development approach, enabling the creation of intuitive and interactive user interfaces.

Node.js: The backend services for the user interface are developed using Node.js, leveraging its event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O operations for scalable and high-performance server-side applications. Node.js enables seamless communication between the frontend and backend through RESTful APIs.

Bootstrap: The user interface utilizes Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, for responsive design and layout components, ensuring optimal viewing and usability across various devices and screen sizes.

Key features of my Project

Responsive Design: Ensured the website is accessible and user-friendly across various devices.

User Authentication: Implemented secure user authentication to protect user data and ensure a personalized experience.

Product Display: Developed a dynamic product display section with advanced filtering options for an enhanced shopping experience.

Shopping Cart: Integrated a fully functional shopping cart system with smooth checkout processes.

Categories Management: Implemented a system that allows the website to organize and display a diverse range of fashion items through multiple categories.

Backend Integration: Collaborated with Sreenath to seamlessly connect the frontend with the backend, ensuring smooth data flow and interactions.

# Myapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
