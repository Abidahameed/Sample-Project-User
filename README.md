# Sample-Project-User
This project is a full-stack web application built using Angular for the front end and Node.js for the backend. It encompasses both user and admin sides, providing distinct interfaces and functionalities tailored to different roles within the application.

This repository contains the user interface for a full-stack web application developed using Angular for the front end and Node.js for the backend. The user interface provides an intuitive and interactive platform for users to access and interact with the various features and functionalities of the web application..

Technologies Used:

Angular: The user interface is built using Angular, a powerful front-end framework for building dynamic and responsive single-page applications (SPAs). Angular provides a modular architecture and component-based development approach, enabling the creation of intuitive and interactive user interfaces.

Node.js: The backend services for the user interface are developed using Node.js, leveraging its event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O operations for scalable and high-performance server-side applications. Node.js enables seamless communication between the frontend and backend through RESTful APIs.

Bootstrap: The user interface utilizes Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, for responsive design and layout components, ensuring optimal viewing and usability across various devices and screen sizes.
